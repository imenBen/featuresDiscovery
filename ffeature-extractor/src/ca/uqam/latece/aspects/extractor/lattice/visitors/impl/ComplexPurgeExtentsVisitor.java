/**
 * This visitor traverses the lattice, and for each node, purges the extent of
 * those classes that are not minimal from an inheritance point of view, EXCEPT
 * when the non-minimum in question has the feature (intent) through other means
 * than other nodes of the extent. This means one of two situations:
 * 
 * 1) either its local domain interface contains the intent. In which case it
 * is considered as an independent occurrence of the feature from that of its
 * other children of the extent, or
 * 
 * 2) the union of its local domain interface AND the cumulative domain interfaces 
 * of its children who are NOT in the extent. I don't know how realistic this second
 * is, and how often we are going to encounter it, but for the sake of exhaustiveness,
 * we need to take it into account  
 * 
 * Instances of the first case are cases where the extent contains an interface and its various 
 * implementations. This is a case where a feature was recognized by the developer as such, and
 * expressed it in an interface. The visitor that identifies candidate nodes should mark it as such

	 * get its ancestors 2) we compute the intersection between the ancestors
	 * and the extent 3) we remove the classes in the intersection from the
	 * extent-- and from further consideration by the method
	 * 
	 * Note that going from class to ancestors is more efficient than going from
	 * class to subclasses, for two reasons: 1) for most classes, there are more
	 * descendants than ancestors to look at 2) if the descendants of a class
	 * intersect with the extent, the only thing we know is that we must remove
	 * the class, whereas with the ancestors, I can remove all the ancestors in
	 * a single swoop
	 * 
	 * If the extent consists of a chain of n elements, by going from class to
	 * ancestors, on the average, I can hope to perform the test n/2 times. With
	 * the descendants, the worst case is the best case is n
